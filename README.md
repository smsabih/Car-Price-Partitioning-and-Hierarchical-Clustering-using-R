This US Cars Dataset data is from the Kaggle Repository and was scraped from AUCTION EXPORT.com. The dataset includes information about 28 brands of clean and used vehicles for sale in US.

For this repo, the focus will be on price, mileage and the year of the vehicle. The analysis will be based on grouping the vehicles according to their price and mileage.

Since clustering uses numeric data, lets organize the dataframe which makes more sense for the purpose of our problem. We can then perform analysis based on year along with grouping based on mileage and price.
